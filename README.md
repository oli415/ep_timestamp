## Thanks
Thank you to JohnMcLear ([ep_stop_writing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_stop_writing)), vimalkvn ([ep_insert_text](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_insert_text)) and Neil Oosten ([ep_chatdate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_chatdate)) for giving me an idea how to implement this.

Thank you to Andreas M. Schneider for providing me with the code for version 0.2.0. The new version prints the date and time in a format that is globally comprehensible (independent of language) and takes time zone differences into account.
